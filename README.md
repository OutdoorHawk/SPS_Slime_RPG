# SPS SLIME RPG

Project was complete in 3 days. The task was to create a 3D clone of the Legend of slime RPG game:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loadcomplete.slimeidle&hl=en_US&gl=US

Create basic shooting mechanics and stat upgrades, as well as any other mechanics from the reference.

From the libraries containing C# code, only Zenject, Dotween and NavMesh were used. 
The architecture of the game was built to accurately control the moment of loading and the game cycle, as well as it is 
predisposed to expanding and adding new mechanics. When creating entities and units, a component-oriented approach was used.
